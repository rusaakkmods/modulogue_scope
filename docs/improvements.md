### Potential Improvements for the ESP32 OLED Oscilloscope Project

1. **Dual Channel Capability**:
   - Add another analog input to allow capturing two signals simultaneously.
   - Utilize another GPIO (e.g., GPIO 35) for the second channel.
   - Update the display to show both channels on the same screen or alternate between them.

2. **External Trigger Input**:
   - Add an external trigger input to allow the scope to trigger on an external digital signal.
   - Use a GPIO (e.g., GPIO 32) as a trigger input pin.

3. **Adjustable Vertical and Horizontal Positioning**:
   - Add buttons or use the rotary encoder to adjust the vertical and horizontal positions of the waveform on the display.
   - Allow the user to offset the waveform to bring different parts into focus.

4. **Higher Sampling Rate with External ADC**:
   - Use an external high-speed ADC module (e.g., ADS1115 or MCP3008) for a higher sampling rate and improved resolution.
   - Interface the external ADC with the ESP32 via SPI or I2C.

5. **FFT (Frequency Analysis)**:
   - Implement a basic **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to display the frequency spectrum of the captured signal.
   - This could help provide insight into the signal's frequency components in addition to time-domain representation.

6. **Data Logging to SD Card**:
   - Add an SD card module to log the captured data for later analysis.
   - The ESP32 can interface with an SD card over SPI, allowing waveform data to be saved.

7. **Wi-Fi Capability**:
   - Utilize the built-in Wi-Fi of the ESP32 to stream the captured waveform to a web server.
   - Create a web interface to view the waveform remotely on a computer or smartphone.

8. **Bluetooth Connectivity**:
   - Add Bluetooth functionality to send data to a smartphone app.
   - You could use a simple terminal app or create a custom app to display the waveform on a mobile device.

9. **Trigger Level Indicator on Display**:
   - Draw a horizontal line on the display to represent the current trigger level visually, making it easier to set and understand.

10. **Automatic Range Adjustment**:
    - Implement automatic range adjustment for both the voltage and time base.
    - The oscilloscope could adapt the scale to fit the signal dynamically.

11. **Built-in Signal Generator**:
    - Integrate a signal generator using one of the PWM-capable GPIO pins.
    - Generate basic waveforms (sine, square, triangle) for testing purposes.

12. **Noise Filtering Options**:
    - Add a menu option for different noise filtering techniques (e.g., moving average, low-pass filter) to improve the stability of the captured waveform.

13. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Enhancements**:
    - Improve the GUI to add a small menu for different modes and settings.
    - Use the rotary encoder to navigate through menus and select options for easier user interaction.

14. **Battery Power and Power Monitoring**:
    - Add a rechargeable Li-ion battery to power the oscilloscope without being tethered to a USB port.
    - Include a battery monitoring circuit to display the remaining battery level on the screen.

15. **Capture Modes**:
    - Add different capture modes, such as:
      - **Single Capture Mode**: Captures one waveform and holds it on the screen.
      - **Normal Mode**: Continuously updates but only displays when triggered.
      - **Auto Mode**: Updates even if no trigger event occurs (useful for continuous signals).

16. **Trigger Slope Selection**:
    - Add an option to choose between **rising edge** and **falling edge** triggering for more flexibility in capturing signals.

17. **Backlight Control for OLED Display**:
    - Implement a way to adjust the brightness of the OLED display or even turn it off to save power when not needed.
